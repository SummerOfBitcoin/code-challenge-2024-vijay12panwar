## Solution Documentation for Summer of Bitcoin 2024 Challenge
### Design Approach
The goal of the Summer of Bitcoin 2024 challenge is to simulate the mining process of a Bitcoin block by processing a series of transactions, validating them, and successfully mining them into a block. This entails the following key steps:

- Reading and Parsing Transactions: Each transaction is represented as a JSON file within the mempool directory. The program reads these files, parses them, and constructs a list of transaction objects.
- Transaction Validation: The transactions must be validated to ensure they are not only structurally correct but also follow the Bitcoin protocol rules such as input and output balance checks.
- Transaction Prioritization: Transactions are prioritized based on the fee-to-weight ratio, which maximizes the miner's profit while respecting the block's weight limit.
- Block Construction: A new block is constructed starting with a coinbase transaction followed by the selected transactions. The block must meet the difficulty target through the Proof of Work mechanism.
- Proof of Work: This critical step involves finding a nonce value that, when hashed with the block header, produces a hash lower than the specified difficulty target.
Output Generation: The final output, including the block header and transaction identifiers, is written to output.txt.

Write output to 'output.txt':
    Line 1: Serialized BlockHeader
    Line 2: Serialized Coinbase Transaction
    Subsequent Lines: Transaction IDs in the order they were added to the Block
### Variables and Algorithms Used
- `Transaction`: Stores details such as transaction ID, inputs, outputs, and witness data.
- `BlockHeader`: Contains fields like version, previous block hash, merkle root, timestamp, bits (difficulty), and nonce.
- `Merkle Tree Calculation`: Used for computing the merkle root of the transactions in the block.
- `SHA-256 Hashing`: Used in transaction validation, merkle tree computation, and block mining.
- `Proof of Work`: Implements a loop that increments the nonce and recalculates the block hash until it meets the difficulty target.

### Results and Performance
The implemented solution successfully mines a block containing valid transactions from the mempool. The performance of the solution is dependent on:

The efficiency of transaction validation and prioritization.
The effectiveness of the Proof of Work algorithm in finding a valid nonce under the given difficulty target.
Conclusion
The challenge provided a comprehensive exercise in simulating the Bitcoin mining process, emphasizing the importance of transaction validation, efficient block construction, and the Proof of Work mechanism. Key insights gained include:

The critical role of transaction fees in transaction selection.
The impact of block size and weight constraints on mining profitability.
Potential areas for future improvement include optimizing the transaction validation process, exploring more efficient data structures for managing the mempool, and refining the Proof of Work algorithm to enhance mining speed.
